This project is a clear implementation of how to work with the API, filter and search data.

I've used these plugins to make this app:
  - bloc
  - cached_network_image
  - conditional_builder_null_safety
  - cupertino_icons
  - dio
  - flutter_bloc
  - hexcolor
  - shared_preferences
  - webview_flutter
